# Pokemon app

What it says. An app using the pokeapi to display all the pokemons, with infinite scroll, flipcard and a search function (ok, ok, several of those things still aren't there, give me time)

## How to start

As with any react app, just go for:

### npm i

and then, 
### `npm start`


## The stack
Something really simple, at least for now:
- typescript
- styled-components
- axios
